The project folder structure is ready to be used in atomic design

#### Standardization and robust structure

One of the main objectives of Atomic Design is to unite basic interface design elements and make the structure of the product or platform more robust and organized.

In this way, the component handling experience is much more optimized, consistent and consistent throughout the product development.

This includes communication between the product development time, which can better visualize the system structure.

#### Scalability

Atomic Design is a modular, component-based system. This methodology makes the development of digital products or interfaces in general more scalable, as it is easier to add new functionalities using this type of system.

#### Focus on user experience

With the use of modular systems based on components, it is much simpler to implement the necessary changes so that the user has a good experience when using an interface.

#### Easy maintenance

Another advantage of Atomic Design is that, when using a system of components, it is easier to carry out tests and maintenance to improve the product.
